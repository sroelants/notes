Notes on *A dream within a dream* by Edgar Allan Poe
=====================================================

A dream within a dream
----------------------
> Take this kiss upon the brow!  
> And, in parting from you now,  
> Thus much let me avow --  
> You are not wrong who deem  
> That my days have been a dream;  
> Yet if hope has flown away  
> In a night, or in a day,  
> In a vision, or in none,  
> Is it therefore the less gone?  
> All that we see or seem  
> Is but a dream within a dream.  
> 
> I stand amid the roar  
> Of a surf-tormented shore,  
> And I hold within my hand  
> Grains of the golden sand --  
> How few! Yet how they creep  
> Through my fingers to the deep,  
> While I weep -- while I weep!  
> O God! can I not grasp  
> Them with a tighter clasp?  
> O God! can I not save  
> one from the pitiless wave?  
> Is all that we see or seem  
> but a dream within a dream?  

Okay, where to start? So, clearly, this is a man saying farewell to the world,
and by extension, his friends and family.  On reading the "take this kiss upon
the brow," one could read it simply as a farewell, but the rest of the poem 
seems to definitively confirm we're talking about a man dying.  

There seems to be a general concensus the speaker's been living a rather 
'meaningless' life (according to whose standards, though?). It is compared to
a dream, most likely because it appears to have been ephemeral, without any 
lasting effect, no proof of it ever having had existence after it's been
extinguished.  Faded and forgotten as soon as it's over.

The dying speaker counterposes that these people are hypocrites. Okay, perhaps
he doesn't state it in such strong words, but none the less, he presses the
point that there is little difference between his life and theirs in the grand 
scheme of things. When life is snuffed out, whether it be a life that was 'a
dream' or a conciously lived life ('in a night or in a day'), whether the life
was lived with a 'vision' in mind or not, life is snuffed out all the same.
Their lives are as insignificant, as certain to be forgotten and meaningless as
his, when all is said and done. All our lives are but dreams: ephemeral,
meaningless episodes in a bigger ephemeral, meaningless world. Perhaps he means
to point out the insignificance of the entirety of human existence on a cosmic
scale? It's not entirely clear what the overarching dream is meant to be, in
which our lives are but 'dreamlike' episodes. I wouldn't go as far as implying
Poe is talking about the world being dreamt up by a higher being, though this
was, of course, a rather popular opinion at some point. (I'm looking at you,
Berkeley.)

The feels come in in during the second stanza, where the rational, confident 
attitude of the speaker becomes more fearful and perturbed. This more emotional
state of mind is conveyed by means of the strongly rhythmic, assonant
"*I stand amid the roar of a surf tormented shore*".  I could just repeat that
phrase all day long. Clearly, the speaker is
standing at the boundary between the safe, well-known land behind and the wild,
unknown, and infinite stretches of ocean ahead. The wild, tormented surf makes
clear how terrifying he finds this prospect.

"*And I hold within my hand grains of the golden sand.*" 
The obvious way to read the image of the sand would be as referring to time,
the sand being likened to sand in an hourglass. Let's just stick with that for
now. It definitely fits together seamlessly: The few grains of sand, the few
moments of life left to him are creeping away. He's desperate to cling on to 
those last fleeting moments of life, those last few grains of sand. He wished
he could save just a single one.  

Particularly powerful then, is the return of what at first was the dying persons
defense against his accusors, the idea that "*all that we are is but a dream
within a dream.*" It's meaning is twisted, however, to a question -- presumably 
towards God? -- to great expressive effect. The question sounds desperate to 
our ears, a last plea, a dying wish and hope to be proven wrong. That the belief
that was held so long, the belief once considered a boon, a defense for
a cavalier and hedonistic life, was mistaken all along. That a life, no matter
how significantly or insignificantly lived, does not simply end with death, and
does not simply fade along with peoples last ebbing memories.

Is all we see or seem but a dream within a dream?

And, as a bonus: this alternate interpretation just popped into my head at some
point, and the further I pursued it, the more amused I was at how well it fits
the poem. (Even though I am rather convinced this interpretation is simply a
fancy of mine, and is in no way what Poe intended to hint at.) What if, rather
than Death, the fearful prospect that so terrifies our subject in the second
stanza is rather the *forgetfulness of old age?* 

Think about it -- *why* would
he be so desperate to *save one from the pitiless wave?* What good would a single
grain of sand do?  Perhaps if the grains of sand represented memories, rather
than time? They are creeping through his hands to the deep. The image of the
deep, dark sea immediately becomes much more vivid when identified with
oblivion, stealing away grain by grain, memory by memory. If only he could grasp
them with a tighter clasp. If only he could *save but one from the pitiless
wave.*  No, instead, memories are slipping through his fingers, so matter how
hard he tries to hang on to them. 
His days are fading away, much like a dream fading away
after waking. He is left standing on the shore, staring at a bleak, blank
void, nothing but chaos and confusion to look forward to. An understandably
terrifying thought.
